  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI generate learning roadmaps?",
    answer: "Our AI analyzes your skills, interests, and educational background. It then cross-references this with effective learning paths and in-demand skills to generate a step-by-step roadmap, complete with curated free resources like articles, YouTube tutorials, and open-source courses.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many free roadmaps can I generate?",
    answer: "On our free Basic plan, you can generate and save up to three personalized learning roadmaps. For unlimited roadmaps and advanced features, you can upgrade to our Pro plan.",

  {
    question: "Why are there daily limits on AI features?",
    answer: "To ensure a high-quality and responsive experience for all our users, we have daily usage limits on AI-powered features like roadmap generation and tutor chats.
